Just got an oil change done on my car..
Salt Lake City, UT
Shakin' this salt like a salt shaker! Aww shoooooot
O'Reilly is flat wrong on oil prices.
Shopping for high quality essential oils online. Any suggestions?
No problems with the lights but the APU is leaking oil. #doneflyingfortoday
Sitting at Lakeland Toyota getting the oil changed...boring. Lol
I hate all the oil rig levels on call of duty. #weplaycod
