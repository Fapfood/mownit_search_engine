Serial killer
I heard there is a serial killer in NC and I was excited. That is screwed up, right?
Bah! I hate serial commas! APA style, you waste punctuation. (Yep, another Saturday night homework party...)
"Never bow to the system, change the system, or create your own." Wish Shepard Fairey had talked to someone about that first comma.
Happy National Punctuation Day?! Anything is a holiday now. I know some people who will really like this b/c it's an inside joke [BRACKET]
There is entirely too much to do in the next five days. Damn you, holidays! Bah humbug ... not really ;)
Really ESPN? Why is USC-Oregon blacked out in West Virginia? I've been waitin on that game all day. Bah!
