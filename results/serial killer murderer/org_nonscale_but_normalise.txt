Serial killer
I heard there is a serial killer in NC and I was excited. That is screwed up, right?
Bah! I hate serial commas! APA style, you waste punctuation. (Yep, another Saturday night homework party...)
maybe i'm late in the game on this one, but this lowender vst is making my apt rumble!
i really hope A.I. makes the most of this second chance in philly. i'm glad he's goin home.
...and if you have ppl that you care about, make sure to let them know. life is too short to lose friends over bullshit. peace and love.
...that shit weighs heavy on me. take responsibility for your life. I don't blame anyone for where I am in this world...
...including his last failed relationship. and while I know that none of it is grounded in reality, and I actually am worried about him...
so...I got a string of texts last night from someone I haven't heard from in a long time blaming me for everything wrong with his life...
thank you echo park. you've changed A LOT, but as long as I'm getting paid to make you move, I'm still with it!
