Serial killer
I heard there is a serial killer in NC and I was excited. That is screwed up, right?
Bah! I hate serial commas! APA style, you waste punctuation. (Yep, another Saturday night homework party...)

There is entirely too much to do in the next five days. Damn you, holidays! Bah humbug ... not really ;)
