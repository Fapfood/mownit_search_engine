And yes, I partied like a rockstar!
Another Friday night at home, I'm livin the life of a rockstar
U were in my dreams last night. Posing in dark glasses. All rockstar.
going to get my last check from Arby's. party like a rockstar! yeah right, haha
Got to school to pick up my two babies, and a huge group of students were chanting DD's name for class president. She is a Rockstar!So Proud
also in Going Overboard, the rockstar's manager is actually played by the great Peter Berg (Hancock, The Kingdom, Fri.Night Lights...)
maybe i'm late in the game on this one, but this lowender vst is making my apt rumble!
i really hope A.I. makes the most of this second chance in philly. i'm glad he's goin home.
...and if you have ppl that you care about, make sure to let them know. life is too short to lose friends over bullshit. peace and love.
...that shit weighs heavy on me. take responsibility for your life. I don't blame anyone for where I am in this world...
